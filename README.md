# CZR Insurance Group - Flood Prediction Analysis

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive **climate risk assessment** for CZR Insurance Group, focusing on **flood prediction in the Western Cape region** (2017-2026). The analysis uses historical climate data and dam levels to predict flood frequency, severity, and associated risks to help optimize insurance pricing and capital allocation strategies.

**Analysis Period:** 2017-2021 (60 months historical data)  
**Forecast Period:** 2026 (12-month predictions)  
**Location:** Western Cape, South Africa

## 📊 Key Insights

### Critical Risk Factors Identified

1. **Precipitation** (Coefficient: 7.11)
   - Most significant predictor of flood events
   - Higher precipitation correlates strongly with flood risk
   - Historical range: ~10-90mm monthly

2. **Dam Levels** (Coefficient: 2.54)
   - Second-most important predictor
   - High dam capacity utilization increases flood spillover risk
   - Critical threshold: >70% capacity

3. **Humidity** (Coefficient: 1.52)
   - Moderate positive correlation with flood risk
   - Indicator of saturated atmospheric conditions

4. **Temperature Range** (Coefficient: -0.89 to -1.24)
   - Negative correlation suggests cooler, wetter conditions increase risk
   - Lower temperatures associated with flood events

### Flood Risk Definition

**Flood events are defined as periods when:**
- Precipitation is in the top 25% of observations, AND
- Dam levels are in the top 25% of observations

**Flood Severity Formula:**
```
Flood Severity = (Precipitation × Dam Level) / 100
```

- **Action:** Document outliers for data quality assessment

### 6. **Predicted vs Actual Flood Risk**
- **Purpose:** Validate model performance
- **Metrics:** R² score, RMSE, MAE
- **Interpretation:** Close alignment indicates reliable predictions

### 7. **2026 Flood Severity Distribution**
- **Purpose:** Forecast future flood patterns
- **Categories:** Low, Moderate, High risk levels

## 🤖 Model Comparison

The analysis evaluates five machine learning models:

| Model | Train RMSE | Test RMSE | Test R² | Test MAE | Overfitting |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Linear Regression** | 0.543 | 2.257 | **0.9685** | 1.751 | 0.026 |
| **Ridge Regression** | 0.642 | 2.338 | 0.9662 | 1.842 | 0.026 |
| **Lasso Regression** | 0.670 | 2.348 | 0.9659 | 1.870 | 0.026 |
| **Random Forest** | - | - | - | - | - |
| **Gradient Boosting** | 0.0002 | 4.941 | 0.8491 | 3.631 | 0.151 |

### Model Selection Rationale

**✅ Recommended Model: Linear Regression**
- **Best Test R²:** 0.9685 (explains 96.85% of variance)
- **Low Overfitting:** Gap of only 2.6%
- **Interpretable Coefficients:** Clear feature importance
- **Stable Performance:** Consistent across train/test sets

**⚠️ Gradient Boosting:** Despite perfect training performance, high test RMSE (4.941) and significant overfitting (15.1%) make it unsuitable for production use.
